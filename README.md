# JS-808

This is a soundless drum machine exercise, built for Splice per instructions at https://github.com/splice/js-808. Based on Create React App for development speed, this program allows users to play three different drum sequences that use four different instruments across 16 steps in time.

## Work To Do

- get this repo set up with create react app, basic structure
- build wireframe UI
- add data for 3 preset sequences
- play/stop functionality

## Future Work / if I get done early (haha)

In case I have the time to add more features than the requirements, these are some todos to tackle:

- make it play actual sound
- how should this look on smaller screens? (consider both stopped and playing states)
- update the UI: can columns be numbered 1-4 with vertical lines separating each 4-beat measure like music? can we make it fancier?
- allow users to add/remove columns?
- add option to loop the sequence
- download / export sequence
- find some fun/known sequences to add
- allow users to update time signature
- allow users update velocity/amp/volume

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
